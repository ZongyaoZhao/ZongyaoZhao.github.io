I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Hong Kong, working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.eee.hku.hk/~yuanwei/index.html">Prof. Yuanwei Liu</a>. I received the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University in 2025, the M.Eng. degree from Tsinghua University in 2021, and the B.Eng. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2018. From 2024 to 2025, I was a visiting researcher at Imperial College London.

My research focuses on Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), Signal Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and Optimization for Next-generation Wireless Systems.
